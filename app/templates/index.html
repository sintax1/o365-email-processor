This is a framework which enables polling of emails from Office 365 
via the Office 365 v1.0 API at regular intervals. Then, each message is 
stored in a database for historical reference/queries and also passed 
to a series of user defined actions for further processing. 

<h3>A couple use cases</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Preventing the execution of malware that is embedded in pdf attachments
    by extracting and forwarding on the text only.</li>
    <li>Sending all email attachments to an antivirus scanning engine.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ol>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('AuthDBView.login') }}">Login</a> (initial login: use the same info provided during the 
        <i>'fabmanager create-admin'</i> step during installation</li>
    <li>Review/Add any <a href="{{ url_for('ActionModelView.list') }}">actions</a> for email processing</li>
    <li>Configure the system <a href="{{ url_for('AppSettingsModelView.list') }}">settings</a>
</ol>

<i>Once you save the system settings (and you enabled 
<b>Enable Automatic Email Checking)</b>, the system will automatically
 begin polling emails at the interval defined in the 
<b>Check Email Interval</b> setting.</i>

<h4>Example Action</h4>
This action extracts the text from the email body and also from any pdf, 
doc, and odt attachments.
